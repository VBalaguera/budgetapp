New function added: NOTES.

<div>expenses - {budget?.name} </div>

budget?, the ? states that if we have a name we will display it;

we're gonna have an empty body, which is fine;

TODO:

-responsive;
-try several night mode alternatives; so far the modals are not working within it. No biggie, but bothers me a little.
-option to extract all data from localStorage to an external json file perhaps?

DONE:
-languageswitcher is hugely better now
-better files/folder structure
-dark-mode // done, revisit styling soon;
-viewexpensesmodal: work on the ternary operator
